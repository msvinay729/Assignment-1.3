1    What are the different methods to call a function in R?

ans:First, you use () as usual, to denote a call to a function, immediately after the keyword function : this can specify the argument, in the example x ;

Secondly, a () couple encircles the function(x) declaration and body;

call(name, …)

is.call(x)

as.call(x)

call returns an unevaluated function call, that is, an unevaluated expression which consists of the named function applied to the given arguments (name must be a quoted string which gives the name of a function to be called).

Note that although the call is unevaluated, the arguments … are evaluated.

call is a primitive, so the first argument is taken as name and the remaining arguments as arguments for the constructed call: if the first argument is named the name must partially match name.

 2   The lazy evaluation of a function means, the argument is evaluated only if it is evaluated only if it is used

inside the body of the function.
